                        ACCIDENTS
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    Aggressive driving behaviors, such as tailgating and improper lane changes, can result in accidents.Alcohol or drug impairment significantly increases the likelihood of accidents. Exceeding speed limits reduces reaction time and increases the severity of accidents.Adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or ice, can make roads slippery and increase the risk of accidents.Lack of experience or improper training may result in poor decision-making on the road. Tired or drowsy driving can impair a driver's ability to focus and react quickly.

                        PARKING ISSUES
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    Many urban areas face a shortage of parking spaces, leading to intense competition for available spots. High demand for parking can result in overcrowded parking lots, making it difficult for drivers to find suitable spaces.Limited spaces may lead to illegal parking in no-parking zones, on sidewalks, and in front of fire hydrants, causing safety hazards. Vehicles searching for parking contribute to traffic congestion as they circulate in search of available spaces.Poorly designed parking facilities may not efficiently use available space, leading to a lower capacity for parking.

                        SIGNAL MALFUNCTION
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    Signal malfunctions disrupt the established traffic patterns, leading to confusion among drivers and pedestrians.Without proper signal guidance, intersections become potential conflict zones, increasing the risk of accidents.Malfunctioning traffic signals often result in uncoordinated movements at intersections, causing traffic congestion.The lack of synchronized signal cycles can lead to bottlenecks, especially during peak hours.Signal malfunctions compromise the safety of road users, as the absence of clear signals increases the likelihood of collisions.Drivers may struggle to anticipate the actions of others, heightening the risk of accidents.

                    <p>
                    Construction activities often require lane closures or temporary road diversions, leading to traffic delays and congestionEfficient planning, clear signage, and real-time communication can help mitigate delays and improve the overall flow of traffic.Changes in road surfaces and unpredictable driving conditions within construction zones demand heightened attention from drivers.Reduced speed limits and increased following distances are essential to accommodate these variations and prevent accidents.Construction zones are workplaces for many individuals, and their safety is of utmost importance. Drivers must exercise caution, follow posted instructions, and be alert to the presence of construction workers.
